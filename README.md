# CareerLite

## TL;DR

This mod locks your funds to 99 999 999 999, and unlocks all technologies. Future plans are to set your reputation level. GUI not included (yet).

## Foreword

I have always been a fan of career mode in Kerbal Space Program. I've played it more or less religiously. However, there comes a time when you have done a lot: built your stations, collected that tricky piece of science data from the outskirts of the Kerbol system. You feel like it would be nice to start over, but you do not want to spend all the time grinding science, but rather build nice rockets and fulfil contracts.

Enter the greatest thing with career mode: the contracts. There are contract packs giving you hundreds of new things to accomplish. You can gain reputation, science or funds for this. You can be told to go to mostly anywhere in the Kerbol system, as well as building satellite networks around your planets. There will always be something for you to do.

Here comes the dilemma that gave birth to this mod: Sandbox mode has no contracts. Science mode has no contracts. It is only in career mode that this wonderful feature is available.

## CareerLite

I call this mod CareerLite - it allows you to play the game your way. As of version 0.1, the features are not many. It basically locks your funds to 99 999 999 999. And there is no way to stop it from doing so (well, if you do find a way, file an issue please!).

One can argue that the functionality is already in the game. You can go into the debug menu and add money, then go build your rockets. Yes, this is true. This is also how I did it before. However, the goal and scope of this mod will be extended.

## Future plans

In 0.5 and beyond, a couple of new features are planned. 
* Lock SCIENCE points so you can buy any technology.
* A way to lock your reputation.

## Releases
